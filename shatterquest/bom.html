<h1>Jaredite Voyage (Ether 1-6):</h1>
<p />
Jared et al. escaped the tower of Babel all speaking the same language (thanks to his brother's high-up connections) and followed the Lord's lead to the seashore. They camped out and forgot to pray for 4 years until the Lord came down, chastised Jared's brother, and gave him some blueprints for barges.
<p />
They made eight small football-shaped wooden barges. But then they realized they had a big problem: there was no light! (The workmen had known the barges were dark for a long time, but had forgotten to report it.) So Jared's brother asked the Lord what to do, but instead of just giving a straight answer, the Lord answered the question with a question: “You can't have windows, they'd be dashed to pieces, what do you want me to do?”
<p />
At this point Mahonri was totally confused since he'd never even seen glass in his life, but he just went with it and thought for a while. He considered his options, but in the end settled on his favorite tool – rocks! (And perpetual energy.)
<p />
So he marched up the mountain, made some lava, and poured some fancy rocks. Then he called to the Lord and said “Alright Lord, I've done my part. I made the rocks. Now I just need you to figure out the perpetual energy thing.” So the Lord poked the rocks and made them all glow. Then he revealed himself to Mahonri, congratulated him, and said “Here's the best part – I've never shown myself to anybody else before!” Mahonri was ecstatic. “Yes! I can't wait to tell Jared,” he thought. “I always knew Adam was lying about seeing the Lord! I always figured the Pearl of Great Price was mis-revealed when it said Enoch saw the Lord stand before his face, and talked with him as a man, face to face!”
<p />
Armed with light, the campers were finally ready to embark on their trans-oceanic voyage. They loaded the barges up with their year's supply of food, fresh water, flocks, herds, beasts, animals, birds, fish tanks, and bees, and set off to the open sea. The tossing upon the waves agitated the bees a bit, and it was admittedly stuffy when the animals pooped and farted with the air hole stopped, but all-in-all it was a pretty uneventful journey. When they weren't busy dodging falling sheep during sudden nose dives they sang praises to the Lord all day.
<p />
In fact, luck would have it that 344 days later all 8 barges washed up together at the shore of the promised land. Their food supply still had 21 days left, but they were down to their last drops of fresh water (the goats drank more water than they planned). Jared was a bit disappointed though. He had bet Mahonri a swarm of bees and two fish tanks that the independent barges would all separate at sea.
<p />
<h1>Ammon (Alma 17-19):</h1>
<p />
Ammon set out on a mission to the land of Ishmael to preach his religion of Judaism and strict observance of the law of Moses to the dark-skinned lazy bunch. On his way into town though, some Lamanites caught him, tied him up, and took him to the king. (It was always fun to guess whether Lamoni was in the mood for killing, imprisoning, or shunning.)
<p />
But when King Lamoni saw Ammon, he asked “Do you want to live with us?”
<p />
“Sure,” replied Ammon, “I want to live with you for a while, maybe even until I die.” Lamoni liked him so he untied the ropes and offered to transfer Ammon the ownership of one of his daughters. Ammon declined. He'd rather just be a servant. Unable to refuse free work, Lamoni assigned Ammon the dead-end job of watching the Sheep.
<p />
Three days later, when Ammon and his new buddies took the sheep to drink some water, other Lamanites scattered the sheep! Luckily Ammon was able to gather them all back up, but then those same pesky Lamanites tried to scatter them again! (Losing sheep was bad. The king killed you if that happened.) “Keep the sheep together,” Ammon told the others, “I'll go fight these dudes.” So Ammon threw some rocks at them with his sling and killed six of them. Then remaining Lamanites, being bad shots, decided to just charge Ammon. They ran at him single file with clubs and took turns trying to whack him. But Ammon just chopped off all their arms! (cleaved the entire limb – flesh, bone, and all – in a single swipe. (Obviously, since otherwise he would have had a hard time convincing them to hold still for sawing or repeated hacking.)) Oh, and by the way, he didn't chop off the leader's arm, he just killed him.
<p />
So Lamoni's servants gathered the arms up and carried them to the king in a bag (and threw the bag in the trash when they were done). The arms were just what Ammon needed to gain the king's confidence and open the door for missionary work. A Christian-centric missionary discussion ensued, after which King Lamoni passed out.
<p />
A couple mornings later, the king finally woke up to Ammon and the queen. He bore his testimony and then all three passed out! And then, everybody in the whole house passed out! Luckily there was one that actually didn't pass out. She was already converted but had kept it a secret (her dad had a vision). She ran from house to house telling everybody to come see what happened.
<p />
Once everybody was together watching, some guy recognized Ammon from the beach and tried to avenge his brother. But when he lifted up his sword with his left hand (Ammon already chopped the other one), he was struck dead on the spot for all to witness. Then the girl that was already converted went and raised the queen from her coma. The queen testified and then raised the king from his coma who also testified. Some people understandably didn't believe in the power of the miracle they had just witnessed so they left, but the others stuck around until Ammon woke up from his coma. Then they all got baptized like good law-of-Moses converts and started a church.
<p />
<h1>Jaredite Final Battle (Ether 13-15)</h1>
<p />
People threw out Ether (the prophet, not the 14th-century Middle English chemistry word of Greek/Latin origin) and then a bunch of wars started. Then Ether went and prophesied to King Coriantumr and told him that if he didn't obey the Lord, every Jaredite would die except for him (and Prophet Ether of course, he was smart enough to hide inside a rock). But nobody repented and they kept fighting. Everybody took up the pastime, fighting with their bands for whatever they wanted.
<p />
They were so wicked that the land got cursed. Unless you slept with your tools and swords, they disappeared! (This was arguably even worse than the Nephies' curse when their treasures just got too slippery to hold on to.) Then the Brother of Shared (not to be confused with the Brother of Jared, who was righteous) got himself an army and stole Coriantumr's throne. So Coriantumr had to hang out in the wilderness for a couple years building up his army. But in the meantime, unluckily for Shared's brother, his high priest murdered him one day while he was sitting on his stolen throne. Shortly thereafter, however, Lib secretly murdered the high priest via secret combination and secretly got himself the kingdom. (Although the secret wasn't very secret, since even Ether the record keeper must have found out about it, and he had been living under a rock!)
<p />
So finally Coriantumr got his army big enough to come fight Lib's army. In the midst of all the fighting, Coriantumr and Lib eventually found each other and Coriantumr chopped him up and killed him. So the Brother of Lib (named Shiz) had to take over.
<p />
Shiz chased and chased Coriantumr, burning up cities and killing women and children along the way. He was determined to avenge the murder of his brother. After a bit more fighting, and once the death toll got up to 2,000,000, Coriantumr repented and wrote Shiz a letter and asked him to please stop fighting. But Shiz would only comply if Coriantumr would surrender himself so he could kill him with his own sword. After that everybody just got mad at each other and they decided to keep fighting. So Coriantumr settled by the Nephite hill Cumorah for the final battle. (And unless Moroni moved the records to a different hill without saying anything about it or his arduous journey transporting them, and Joe named that other hill Cumorah too, this hill where the Jaredites got wiped out was the same hill where the Nephites had their final battle, the same hill where where Mormon hid up the records, and the same hill where Joe dug them up. But of all the swords, shields, head plates, breastplates, weapons, and skeletons on the millions of slain warriors, and even though the Nephites found Jaredite remains, the only artifacts on this hill that were preserved until the 19th century were the gold plates. And even those were only witnessed by Joe and 3 + 8 others, and now that the angel took them away from Earth, we are down to exactly zero artifacts preserved from the hill Cumorah.)
<p />
Anyway, then the Jaredites gathered up every single person except Ether to either Shiz's army or  Coriantumr's. Men even suited up their wives and children for battle. Once the last person in the land finally enlisted, they marched against each other and fought all day, then cried all night. Then the next day they fought all day and cried all night again. Finally Coriantumr surrendered and wrote Shiz a letter and said “Please take over, we don't want to fight anymore.” But it didn't work so they fought all day again, and again. At this point 52 were left in Coriantumr's army and 69 left with Shiz. They must have had dead-even recruiting skills in order to have produced such perfectly matched armies. The next day 37 Shiz-ites bit the dust, while only 5 Coriantumr-ites died. And within a couple more days, every single human on the entire continent had been killed except Coriantumr and Shiz (and Ether of course, who was the only one who knew how to hide). Shiz had even fainted from blood loss! So Coriantumr went and chopped his head off. Then Shiz did a headless pushup (his dad may have been part chicken), struggled for breath, and died. Finally, Coriantumr fainted from blood loss. (Don't worry, none of the other millions of people had fainted and been mistaken for dead. They were, in fact, very much dead.)
<p />
Finally, to the relief of Ether, he was able to stop hiding in that cramped rock. He finished the record and wandered around a lone hermit for the rest of his life. He knew Coriantumr was still alive, and had in fact repented, but he figured he'd rather be alone than have a social life. Coriantumr also ended up wandering around alone for most the rest of his life, but he eventually hooked up with the Mulekites shortly before his real death.
<p />
<h1>Korihor (Alma 30)</h1>
<p />
An anti named Korihor showed up in Zarahemla and caused them to question their faith, saying things like "How can anybody know what will happen in the future?" "How do you know your beliefs are true if you haven't seen them?" "What if your spiritual experiences were just fabricated by your frenzied minds?" "You've been brainwashed," "You can't see clearly because your parents indoctrinated you from birth," etc. He was quite successful in encouraging many Zarahemlans to rethink their beliefs. 
<p />
Then Korihor went to Jershon and tried to tell them the same things, but they were "smarter" than the Nephites. Even though there were intentionally no laws against a man's belief (because that would be strictly contrary to the commands of God), they tied Korihor up and carried him to Ammon, who banished him from the city. 
<p />
So Korihor, though bitter about being denied his legal rights, gave up on Jershon and went on to Gideon. But there they tied him up again! This time they brought him to Giddonah who challenged "Why do you tell people their beliefs aren't true and interrupt their rejoicings???" Korihor tried to explain his views about intellectual honesty, fighting ignorance, and liberation from bondage. The Giddonahn leaders didn't have a response to Korihor's argument, so instead they just shipped him off to Alma, the big man in charge. 
<p />
Once before Alma, Korihor stood his same ground as before. Alma pointed out that Korihor had no evidence to back his position, said everything gives a testimony of God and Christ, and claimed Korihor felt the way he did because he was actively pushing away the Spirit. Korihor, refusing to accept gut feelings as conclusive evidence, told Alma he would not believe without real, tangible, demonstrable, material evidence. Alma was distraught. “You already have evidence! You other peoples' testimonies! You have the scriptures! The earth! Other planets! Isn't that enough?” Korihor replied that he didn't deny the existence of a God; he just could not and would not follow every single whimsical claim without adequate proof.
<p />
At this point Alma was bummed by Korihor's obstinance, but, figuring it was for the greater good, struck Korihor dumb in the name of God right there on the spot. Korihor could still hear just fine, but for whatever reason, the chief judge though he had to write to him. So he sneeringly wrote “Do you believe now???” Korihor, just like every other anti who's been struck dumb by the prophet, wrote back that it was evidence enough for him, and he knew it was the power of God that had done it. He then took it even farther and admitted that he always knew there was a God. Just one day the devil disguised himself as an angel and appeared to him and tricked him into thinking there wasn't a God, and since that day he had been resisting the truth. Then Korihor asked Alma to take back the curse but Alma said “No, I think you'll just go back to leading people astray if I take the curse back,” so Korihor stayed dumb.
<p />
Then the chief judge sent out a proclamation about what happened to Korihor and threatened everybody who listened to him with the same fate if they didn't repent. So everybody got convinced of Korihor's wicked ways and converted back to the Lord, and order was restored again. As for Korihor, was forced to just go from house to house begging for food. Then when we was begging the Zoramites for some food, some reckless kids came flying around the corner in their chariots and ran over him and trampled him to death. And that is the end of an anti.
<p />
<h1>The Stripling Warriors (Alma 56-67)</h1>
<p />
War broke out between the Nephites and the Lamanites, but the Nephites made the people of Ammon stay out on the conscientious objector basis (they had buried their weapons of war and promised the Lord they'd never fight again). But the teenagers didn't make any oaths like that, so they went out and fought instead.
<p />
The teenagers saw two bloody, gruesome battles. Thousands of people died on both sides, but not a single one of the teenagers was killed (although every one of them got injured, and some even passed out from blood loss). They out-survived their older, stronger, more experienced Nephite peers because they had more faith. They knew that God is just, so if you don't doubt, He'll preserve you.
<p />
